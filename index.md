### CPSC 120
* Lab 2 
    Lab 2, part 1 was required to edit the given file, and then change that file's format to match Google's C++ style. I like this one because I learned how to use the command check_formatting to automatically check the file's format. It was very easy and convenient.
* Lab 3
    Lab 3, part 1 was my favorite because I learned how to print out protein, bread, and condiment based on the user's input for the variable. The user should type the protein first, bread goes to second, and condiment goes to last. I used the std::string variable to store the PROTEIN, BREAD, and CONDIMENT because they were words.
* Lab 5
    Lab 5, part 1 was my favorite because this part was very similar to the lab I did before, which was Lab 3, part 1. But in Lab 5, part 1, I had to use std::vector to determine the size of the arguments. If the input did not meet the requirements of the size of the arguments, it would print out an error. Overall, it was very fun and not difficult.
